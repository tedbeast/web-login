         * You will be completing the login portion of this site, and the registration code has already been provided.
         * Check out the registration code first in register.html. You can use it as a reference here.
         *
         * The code for conducting a proper log in should be very similar to what was done in register.html.
         * Again, let's ignore the backend api/database logic necessary to actually conduct a login, and instead
         * hardcode a login: let's say that we will permit a login only when the username is "user" and the password
         * is "password". If the login is successful, change the text in the <p> tag with id loginMessage to "welcome,
         * user!", and if the login is unsuccessful, change the text in that <p> tag to "login unsuccessful, please
         * try again"
